# Algorithm visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a React based interactive Web application for visualizing algorithms generated from code. These applications are used to illustrate the operation of a certain algorithm to simplify the process of learning that algorithm. In this paper, implementation, and visualizations of path-finding algorithms, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms and trie has been done. Following that, these visuals have been used to analyze and compare the performance of each of these algorithms. 

## List of Implemented Algorithms
- Path Finding
  - Breadth First Search
  - Depth First Search
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Sorting
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Bubble Sort
- Searching 
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- Trie
